# Initial setup

The docker file provided in the initial assignment is used with its set of data. The version of postgresql is 16 in this dockerfile.

You can execute the provided Dockerfile by running:

```bash
docker build -t ratestask .
```

This will create a container with the name *ratestask*, which you can
start in the following way:

```bash
docker run -p 0.0.0.0:5432:5432 --name ratestask ratestask
```

You can connect to the exposed Postgres instance on the Docker host IP address,
usually *127.0.0.1* or *172.17.0.1*. It is started with the default user `postgres` and `ratestask` password.

```bash
PGPASSWORD=ratestask psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U postgres
```

alternatively, use `docker exec` if you do not have `psql` installed:

```bash
docker exec -e PGPASSWORD=ratestask -it ratestask psql -U postgres
```

Keep in mind that any data written in the Docker container will
disappear when it shuts down. The next time you run it, it will start
with a clean state.
